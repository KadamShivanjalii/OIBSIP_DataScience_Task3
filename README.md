# Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts the selling price of a used car based on multiple factors such as the year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, transmission type, and ownership history.  
Car price prediction plays an important role in the automobile industry and helps buyers and sellers make informed decisions.
