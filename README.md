# Unemployment Analysis in India

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing unemployment trends in India using a real-world dataset. The aim is to study variations in unemployment rates over time and present insights through data analysis and visualization using Python.

---

## Objective
- Analyze unemployment data using Python  
- Understand trends and patterns in unemployment rates  
- Visualize unemployment statistics for better interpretation  
- Apply data analysis techniques on a real dataset  

---

## Dataset
- **Dataset Name:** Unemployment Rate up to 2020  
- **File Format:** CSV  
- **File Used:** `Unemployment_Rate_upto_11_2020.csv`  
- **Source:** Provided as part of the internship task  

The dataset is uploaded manually in Google Colab before executing the code.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Python  
- Google Colab  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  

---

## Project Structure
- `unemployment_analysis.py` – Python script containing the complete analysis  
- `README.md` – Project documentation  

---

## Steps Performed
1. Imported required Python libraries  
2. Loaded the unemployment dataset using Pandas  
3. Examined dataset structure and summary information  
4. Converted date column to datetime format  
5. Analyzed unemployment trends  
6. Visualized the data using Matplotlib

## How to Run the Project (Google Colab)
1. Open Google Colab  
2. Upload the dataset file:  
   `Unemployment_Rate_upto_11_2020.csv`  
3. Upload or paste the code from `unemployment_analysis.py`  
4. Ensure the dataset path in the code is:  
   `/content/Unemployment_Rate_upto_11_2020.csv`  
5. Run the code cells  
6. View outputs and visualizations

## Output
- Dataset shape and information  
- Summary statistics  
- Unemployment trend visualizations  

---

## Learning Outcomes
- Hands-on experience with real-world data  
- Improved data cleaning and analysis skills  
- Understanding of unemployment trend analysis  
- Practical experience with Pandas and Matplotlib
